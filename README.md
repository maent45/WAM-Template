# WAM-Template
Bootstrap Template for What's Around Me Web App

A template created using Bootstrap for the WAM (What's Around Me?) web app for SoT Hackfest 2015. At the moment it is static but will be used to render data retrived from WellyNews API, Weather API, EventFinda API, and NZTA API.

More awesome stuff will also be added into it later on.. 

NOTE: In the "site.zip" is contained the latest version of the template along with the API calls written in jQuery to fetch data from the different APIs implemented.
